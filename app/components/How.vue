    <p class="font-bold text-[20px] lg:ml-[150px]">Using Token Risk Scanner is easy and takes just a few seconds. Here’s what happens under the hood:<br><br>

<b>1. Paste a Token Address</b>
You enter the contract address of any token you want to check. It can be on Ethereum, Binance Smart Chain, Polygon, or Avalanche. (Solana support coming soon!)
<br><br>
<b>2. We Query Trusted Security APIs</b>
Our backend securely sends the address to third-party security services (like Webacy and others). These services analyze the token’s smart contract, behavior, and history.
<br><br>
<b>3. The Scanner Returns Key Info</b>
We display the results in a clean, readable format:
<br><br>
<b>Risk Score:</b> A number from 0 to 100 representing the token's potential risk.
<br><br>
<b>Tags: </b>Flags that tell you if the contract is trusted, mintable, has high gas use, etc.
<br><br>
<b>Smart Contract Findings:</b> Technical warnings like possible exploits or vulnerabilities in the code.
<br><br>
<b>4. You Decide What’s Safe</b>
Based on the data, you can make a more informed decision about interacting with or investing in the token. We don’t give financial advice—we just provide transparent data.
